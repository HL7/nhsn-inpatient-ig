[Unable to determine whether the provided codes are in the value set http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-medication-codes because the value set or a code system it depends on is not known to the validator]
# Value set is in VSAC but hasn't been downloaded to FHIR IG package yet (see Zulip thread: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/VSAC.20Package)
The valueSet reference http://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1146.1270 on element Observation.code.coding could not be resolved
# Examples have optional slices not defined in profile - not matching is expected behaviour
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-organization
# US Core profiles are parents of other profiles, matching both the parent and child is expected behaviour
Found multiple matching profiles for Observation/observation-lab-sars-cov-med-admin among choices: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/nhsn-med-admin/StructureDefinition/Observation-lab-sars-cov, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-observation-lab
Found multiple matching profiles for Condition/condition-suspected-covid-med-admin-1 among choices: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/nhsn-med-admin/StructureDefinition/Condition-suspected-covid, http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition
# Expected reasoning as condition-suspected-covid-med-admin-1 matches Condition-suspected-covid (not Condition-lab-confirmed-covid)
Details for Condition/condition-suspected-covid-med-admin-1 matching against Profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/nhsn-med-admin/StructureDefinition/Condition-lab-confirmed-covid
